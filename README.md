# Portfolio Project - Playstation 2 Menu
Video games were my childhood escape. But even beyond the fantastical worlds, one interface left a surprisingly strong impression: the PlayStation 2 menu. It wasn't a flashy game title screen, but the simple act of navigating memory cards held a strange allure. Hours were spent (guiltily, perhaps) flipping through saves, watching the animations flicker to life.

This project and website reimagines that nostalgic experience as a playful portfolio. Gone are the memory cards; in their place, a virtual library of my professional endeavors and creative side hustles. It's a homage to the PS2 menu, with a twist of self-expression.
